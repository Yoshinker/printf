# printf
Why using printf from stdio library when you can code it ?

## goal
I hate importing <stdio.h> in every C and C++ project.
So I'm working to create my own printf.
Simply.

## roadmap
[] Manage exceptions on basic functions
[] 42's norm <3
[] Manage more type (pointer, unsigned type, hexa / octal number)
[] Code my own va_list (to substitute stdarg.h)
[] Errno specific messages

###### bonus

[] Read (and understand) open source printf source code
